Changelog for package rosbag_fancy
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1.1.0 (2024-03-19)
------------------
* play: refuse to play non-monotonic bags
* Add --no-ui for play with status info and start/stop/pause services (PR #19)
* cmd_play: basic topic information in status message
* rosbag_fancy: link executable for devel space
  Fixes rosbag_fancy usage in catkin devel spaces (which is the default
  with catkin_make and catkin_tools). I mainly test & develop with colcon,
  so I did not notice so far that the command was not available properly.
